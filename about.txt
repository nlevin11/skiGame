Purpose
- Create a game with depth and 2D graphics where a skier goes down a slope, jumping over and dodging obstacles. This is meant to be a soothing yet exciting experience. The objective is to reach the highest score possible, attained by completing tricks and staying alive for longer.

Functionality
Core features
- The user uses the a & d or left and right arrow keys to move the skier left/right
- Points continually go up as the skier moves downhill- 1 point per second
- When in the air after going off a jump, the skier can use the w & s keys or the up & down arrows to flip
    - 10 points per flip
- The game is over when the skier hits an obstacle or does not land on their skis
- The score of each game equates to the in-game currency received
- A shop to use currency received in-game to buy new gear- including headwear, jackets, pants, and skis
    - These are cosmetic only
    - 3 different colors of all gear

User flow/mechanics
- Start screen- displays the skier in the background with a central icon directing the user to press space to play
    - (the shop icon is in one corner)
    - A graphic in another corner that displays the local high score
Gameplay
- There are occasional rocks and trees on the slope that end the game when hit- use left/right keys to dodge the obstacles
    - Skier crash animation is shown when obstacles are hit
- There are also occasional jumps– when the skier goes over the jump they can do tricks, giving extra points
    - When a jump or jumps are landed, there is a popup on the screen that shows how many points are rewarded
Progression- the skier slowly moves faster as the game progresses
- At a certain speed where the game becomes very difficult, the skier reaches a speed cap
- Obstacles appear at a constant rate throughout the game
- The air time of a jump increases as the skier reaches higher speeds
Game over screen- displays game over and a crashed skier animation
- Then returns to the home screen and shows the most recent score

Aesthetics
Model of the skier with different gear on
- images 2, 3, 4
The background
- image 1
The jumps and obstacles
- images (2), 2 (1), 5
Color scheme
- Palette- Mostly blue/greenish-tinted shades of white as shown above, especially in the image of the background
- The skier can wear gear that is blue, red, or black to pop out against the white background
Typography
- Soft font to maintain the relaxed nature of the game
- One such font is the “wintry” font- can be found with a google search
- The text should be readable against the white background- probably in a darker shade of blue or green to keep up with the palette
